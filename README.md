# Entity-Component Systems & Data Oriented Design In Unity
This repository contains the article [**Entity-Component Systems & Data Oriented Design
In Unity**](https://github.com/LifeIsGoodMI/ECS-And-DoD-In-Unity/blob/master/ECS_Unity_Article.pdf), 
[**A custom documentation of the core principles of Unity's ECS**](https://github.com/LifeIsGoodMI/ECS-And-DoD-In-Unity/blob/master/The_Core_Of_Unitys_ECS_Documentation.pdf), 
[**A start guide to Unity's ECS**](https://github.com/LifeIsGoodMI/ECS-And-DoD-In-Unity/blob/master/ECS_StartGuide.pdf) 
as well as the respective Unity project.

It appears that GitHub's PDF viewer doesn't support hyperlinks :( So, if you want to use that function, you probably have to open the PDF in your browser.
